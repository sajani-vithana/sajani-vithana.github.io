I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard, working in Prof. Flavio Calmon's research group. My research focuses on the foundations of trustworthy AI, with an emphasis on developing information-theoretic models to explore the fundamental trade-offs between performance and ethical concerns in AI system components. I am particularly interested in tackling critical challenges related to privacy, fairness, and reliability. Using tools from coding theory, optimization, signal processing, probability, and statistics, I design robust algorithms that contribute to building equitable and reliable AI systems.
